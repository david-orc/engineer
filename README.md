**Engineer** is a powerful command-line tool to help track and consolidate SharePoint configuration changes in any number of environments. It's like version control for site columns, content types, lists, views, and more.

**[Explore Engineer Documentation](http://sp-engineer.org)**

Engineer is inspired by [Laravel](https://laravel.com) migrations, and is made possible by [PnP-JS-Core](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-JS-Core), [node-pnp-js](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/node-pnp-js), and [CSOMNode](https://github.com/vgrem/CSOMNode).

## Getting Started

```sh
npm i -g sp-engineer
```

Once installed, you can type `engineer` into any console prompt to run Engineer commands. Use `engineer -h` to see a list of [commands](http://sp-engineer.org/commands/).

### Start a New Project

```sh
engineer init
```

The [`init`](http://sp-engineer.org/commands/init) command creates `env.js` in the current working directory. This file contains important configuration information such as the SharePoint site URL and authentication settings. Any authentication configuration supported by [node-sp-auth](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/node-sp-auth) can be used as the `auth` settings in your `env.js` file.

### Install Engineer Lists

Once your `env.js` file is set up, you're ready to install Engineer lists to your target SharePoint environment.

```sh
engineer install
```

## Migrations

Engineer uses **migrations** to track configuration changes made to SharePoint. You can use migrations to create a queue of tasks that are executed in order on any number of target environments. Think of migrations like source control for your configuration operations.

### New Migration

```sh
engineer make my-first-migration
```

The [`make`](http://sp-engineer.org/commands/make) command creates a file called `migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-my-first-migration.js` (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` is replaced by the current UTC timestamp). Feel free to open this file to see what's inside. By default, new migrations are configured to create a new list called `My List` when migrated.

### Migrate

```sh
engineer migrate
```

The [`migrate`](http://sp-engineer.org/commands/migrate) command activates pending migrations. A new list called `My List` will be created on the target SharePoint site when this migration is activated.

### Roll Back

```sh
engineer rollback
```

The [`rollback`](http://sp-engineer.org/commands/rollback) command retracts active migrations. Once rolled back, `My List` is deleted from the target SharePoint site.

### Multiple Environments

You can create copies of `env.js`, allowing you to store authentication and configuration for multiple SharePoint environments. Use Engineer's [`--config`](http://sp-engineer.org/commands/#config) option to switch environments when running any command.

```sh
engineer -c env/dev.js migrate
engineer -c env/prod.js migrate
```
